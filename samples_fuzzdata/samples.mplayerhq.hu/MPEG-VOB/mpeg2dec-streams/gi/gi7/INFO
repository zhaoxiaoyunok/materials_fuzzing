Dear Sam,
Dear Video Conformance Testing HAG members,

This is to report that I have received your tape with
your conformance bitstream gi7 (Bitstream ID = 1).

I have checked the bitstream and I found no problem.
I also get a perfect match with the reconstructed frames
that you provided.

However, it looks like you have used an incorrect preprocessing
filter, and the images that you have encoded look terrible.  There are
some areas where white has turned to black, like if you had used
a filter that did some wraparound instead of saturation in [0, 255].

Regards,
