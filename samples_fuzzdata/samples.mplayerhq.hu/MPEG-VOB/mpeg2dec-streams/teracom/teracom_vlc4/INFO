Dear Harald,
Dear Video Conformance AHG members,

This is a (late - sorry) report to confirm that I have been able
to decode successfully your bitstream video conformance test
bitstream teracom_vlc4 (this bitstream replaces teracom_vlc3).

I have observed a perfect match except for ONE pel with a mismatch
of +/- 1:

$ cmp -l my_reconstructed teracom_vlc4.tosh
32439007  76  75
^          ^   ^
|          |   |
|          differing bytes (octal)
|
byte number (decimal)

Interestingly enough, I find this very same mismatch pel with both our
proprietary software decoder and the technical report verifier.  If you
have time, you should confirm that this is caused by a genuine IDCT
mismatch.

It should be noted that tcela-17 is somehow redundent with
teracom_vlc4, since teracom_vlc4 also tests large motion vectors.
However tcela-17 provides an immediate visual checking for correct
implementation of large motion vectors.

Regards,
