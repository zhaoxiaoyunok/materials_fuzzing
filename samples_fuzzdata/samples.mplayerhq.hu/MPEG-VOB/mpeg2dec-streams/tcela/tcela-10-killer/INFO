No problem found.

Note: The encoder that was used to produce this bitstream did not implement
the recommendation expressed in Note 2 of section 7.4.4.

I have included the vbv trace file.

Note: in the vbv trace file included, the  value of Buffer_fullness
(before removing any headers) is known to be sometimes incorrect,
due to a bug in my trace program.  This does not affect the other
Buffer_fullness values.
