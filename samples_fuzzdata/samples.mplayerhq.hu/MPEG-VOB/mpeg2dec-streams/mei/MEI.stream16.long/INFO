Only minor problems found with this bitstream.

---------------------------------------------------------------

This is to confirm that I have received your tape with 
the "long" versions of MEI.stream16 and MEI.stream17.

I have checked MEI.stream16.long, and the only problem that
I found is a couple of frames where I get a vbv_delay mismatch.

I have included the vbv trace file (search for the word "warning").

Note: in the vbv trace file included, the  value of Buffer_fullness
(before removing any headers) is known to be sometimes incorrect,
due to a bug in my trace program.  This does not affect the other
Buffer_fullness values.
