Dear Sam,

I looked at your bitstream gi6, and I found some small problems.

1) Contrary to what the readme file says, you have used
   a bitrate of 14900400 Mb/s, instead of 15 Mb/s as recommanded.

2) I observe small but suspicious vbv_delay mismatch.
   I have enclosed a full trace of vbv_delay and VBV buffer occupancy
   for gi6.  Look for the word "warning".
   
   For example, just after removing picture start-code of the first B-frame,
   the VBV buffer contains 568835.60 bits.
   The formula gives vbv_delay = (568835.60 * 90000) / 14900400 = 3435.827
   
   The value in your bitstream (3437) is incorrect.

   Note: in the vbv trace file included, the  value of Buffer_fullness
   (before removing any headers) is known to be sometimes incorrect,
   due to a bug in my trace program.  This does not affect the other
   Buffer_fullness values.

   
3) I get 11332 pels (over 2073600) i.e. 0.546% with a mismatch of +-1.

   This is probably because you did not use a floating-point IDCT
   in your encoder, or in the decoder that produced the reconstructed
   frames that you have provided.
   
   We recommand to use a floating-point IDCT for generating the
   reconstructed frames associated with the Conformance bitstreams.
